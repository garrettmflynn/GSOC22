 My Journey with Google Summer of Code 2022


## My Project
*An Open-Source Software Suite for EEG Artifact Annotation on Web Browsers*

Artifacts are parts of a measured signal generated from sources other than those of interest. For electroencephalography (EEG) data, artifacts from a variety of physiological and environmental sources must be excluded or repaired to ensure that appropriate interpretations are applied during clinical evaluation and downstream analyses. We will develop a suite of web-based tools for facilitating artifact annotations for the Global EEG Norms project of the Global Brain Consortium (GBC). This project will enable clinical neurophysiologists to upload EEG data in standardized formats; annotate data with artifacts, such as electrical noise and movement artifacts, using a novel ontology that is interoperable with the Hierarchical Event Descriptors specification; and export this data to the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard. While the resulting libraries of this project will be integrated into a Progressive Web Application for clinical neurophysiologists, they will also be released standalone as tools to further facilitate the development of neuroscience tools on the Open Web. This could reduce the barriers to entry for neurophysiology research by enabling standalone data management and analysis applications to be released on modern browsers. In the long run, this may enable the rapid diagnosis of neurological disorders in lower to middle-income countries with unreliable internet connections.
